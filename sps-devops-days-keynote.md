Failure States in Distributed systems applied to teams:
There's no TCP stream in between People. ACK/NACK

"We replaced our monolith with a micro service architecture, so every outage can be more like a murder mystery"
- Distributed Systems and Teams are inherently micro service architecture

Martin Fowler talks about Distributed Teams and Remote workers.
One or two remote people is not a distributed team

Choose the tools people will use more than the tools that are best.

Two main groups: Synchronous vs Async. 

Sync is 
* Twitter DM,
* Slack,
* Google Docs,
* Hangouts,
* etc. 
Async is
* Twitter DM,
* Slack,
* Google Docs,
* Trello,
* SocialPass
* Github,
* etc.

Communicate expectations on how you use tools clearly.

"Documentation in the Viking Tradition: Let me tell you the Saga of my System"

"Durable communications" => Written down, historical record

TCP Streaming between people is VERY verbose. (and that's ok)

Always let the team know when you are and aren't going to be available.

Be explicit about actions and decisions

Coordination surprise: If you don't check in often with distributed folks, you're going to continue to diverge quite far.

Nonviolent Communications and Emotional Literacy. 
- Nonjudgemental
- Ask for what you need, 
- Don't blame someone,
- don't expect to be blamed

Examine Assumptions
- Be Explicit about what we're expecting to be true
- Expect Failures, and plan for them.

Distribute Decision making
- Overcommunicate
- Resolve things as early as possible.  

Software is made of feelings
