What are Microservices Again?
---

"The Microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collecitno of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities"
Chris Richardson - microservices.io

Focusing on a single module

Microservices Allow developers to come up to speed faster, make changes faster, make an impact sooner. 

The codebase is a "shared dependency", can block other developers unintentionally

Having a Contract is good.
