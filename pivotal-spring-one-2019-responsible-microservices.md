Responsible Microservices
===

Domain Driven Development has caused some pain

Microservices are good (for some purposes)
  - Don't just adopt patterns because they're in a catalog

Please Microservice Responsibly
"Should that be a microservice" blog series

Things that change a lot should probably be microservices. 

Quarterly releases are a compromise.

Make educated guesses about what changes a lot.
 - But back it up with data when you can
 - Git can tell you what your hotspots are

Strangler pattern Again

Replacing a thing wholesale is really hard. Every line of code is a bug fix, so you have to fix the bug again if you rewrite.

 Hyptothesis driven development

 Fitness functions can actuall happen with Microservices. 

 Repeat the things that are hard often, to make them easier.

 "That's how we've always done it" is a terrible phrase.

 Monitoring is important

 Site Reliability Engineering book is good.

 Latency, Traffic Level, Error Rate, Are my Resources Saturated?

 What's your sampling rate?

 Avoid resume Driven Design

 Don't pay that complexity tax unless you're getting something in return.
