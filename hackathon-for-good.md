# Data

* Open Data is more common in the public sector than in private sector
* Minnesota requires Govt. Data to be open, minus a bunch of exceptions ( mostly around PII )
* Private sector is only required to open up some specific reporting data

## Important considerations

* Primacy/Source, 
* MetaData, 
* Age,
* Accessibility,
* Machine Readability,
* Discoverability,
* Access Requirements,
* Public Domain,
* Permanence
